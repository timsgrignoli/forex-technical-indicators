# Generate CSV
This MQL4 script can be used to generate a CSV across different symbols, indicators, and indicator settings over a period of time of for a particular timeframe.

## How to Use
1. Make sure MetaTrader 4 is installed and connected to your broker.  This may be different depending on your country.  In the US, I use [Oanda](https://www.oanda.com/us-en/trading/platforms/metatrader-4/) (which is also why this is written in MQL4 because they did not support MT5).
1. Download generate-csv.mq4 and move to your "Scripts" folder
1. Download utility-functions.mqh and move to your "Include" folder
